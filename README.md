# # Riot ID name + tagline | League of legends lol id name + tagline| Valorant name id name + tagline  Changer


Uses Riot's Local Client API (LCU). Works only if the Riot Client is running and logged in.
It makes just two requests per change: validate ID → apply change.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Riot Client running
* `requests` library (`pip install requests`)

## Usage

```bash
# Windows
python riot_id_changer.py
# Or, if Python isn't recognized, replace <PATH_TO_PYTHON> with your Python path:
<C:\PATH_TO_PYTHON\python.exe> riot_id_changer.py

# Mac
chmod +x riot_id_changer.py
./riot_id_changer.py
```

Or run the Windows executable.

Follow instructions:

## Troubleshooting

1. After installing Python, **restart your shell** to ensure changes take effect.
2. If Python or `requests` isn’t recognized, use the **full path** (see example above).
3. Make sure the Riot Client is running and logged in before using the script.
