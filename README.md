 # league-of-legends-lol-valorant-riot-id-name-changer


This script uses Riot's local client API (LCU). It only works if the Riot Client is running and you're logged in.  
It doesn't spam the API â€” it only makes a couple of requests when you ask it to:
- One to validate the ID
- One to apply the change if you confirm

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Riot Client running and logged in
- `requests` library installed

## Usage
Navigate to the  .py file in your shell of choice.  
Run:
```bash
**Windows:**:
pip install requests
python riot_id_changer.py
./riot_id_changer.py
**Mac:**:
chmod +x riot_id_changer.py
./riot_id_changer.py

```
Or run executable windows.

I have no affilation to Riot games. Use responsibly at your own risk. Example of acting like a sp*az: blowing up lcu connector with 211043 name change  requests.
